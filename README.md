# Repository Note

Initially, each service was developed in a seperate repository.
During the dockerizing stage I realized I should have put them in a signle repository

The original repositories with commit history are still available at:
- [Frontend Service](https://github.com/amrkhanfar/bazar-frontend)
- [Catalog Service](https://github.com/amrkhanfar/bazar-catalog)
- [Order Service](https://github.com/amrkhanfar/bazar-order)
